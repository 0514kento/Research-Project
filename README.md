## 📘 Overview

This research explores a timeless question: **Is success driven more by talent, effort, or sheer luck?**

Using **multi-agent simulation** and **reinforcement learning (Q-learning)**, this project builds upon the _Talent vs. Luck (TvL)_ model proposed by Pluchino et al., extending it with agents capable of learning from their environment to test whether effort can consistently overcome randomness.

---

## 🔬 Methodology

- **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Agents move through a grid-based environment encountering lucky and unlucky events.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning is used to simulate agent learning and adaptive behavior.
- **Metrics**: Success is measured by accumulated virtual assets over simulated lifetimes.
- **Variables**: Agents are initialized with varied talents and learning abilities (effort proxy).

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- **Luck remains the dominant factor** in determining extreme success—even when learning is introduced.
- Neither high talent nor strong learning rate alone guarantees wealth or top performance.
- Learning (effort) can act as a **multiplier** but cannot substitute for opportunity.
- Emergent wealth distributions closely mimic **real-world inequality (Pareto distributions)**.

## 🧠 Implications

This study challenges the meritocratic assumption that success is purely earned. It shows how randomness, often overlooked, plays a powerful role in shaping careers and outcomes—and suggests the need for more nuanced views of fairness and reward.
